//! Integration with sqlx-sqlite-conn-mgr crate.
//!
//! This module provides observation capabilities for databases managed by
//! `sqlx-sqlite-conn-mgr`. Enable with the `conn-mgr` feature.
//!
//! Uses SQLite's native hooks for transaction-safe change tracking. Changes
//! are buffered during transactions and only published after commit.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//! use sqlx_sqlite_conn_mgr::SqliteDatabase;
//! use sqlx_sqlite_observer::{ObservableSqliteDatabase, ObserverConfig};
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//!    let db = SqliteDatabase::connect("mydb.db", None).await?;
//!    let config = ObserverConfig::new().with_tables(["users", "posts"]);
//!    let observable = ObservableSqliteDatabase::new(db, config);
//!
//!    let mut rx = observable.subscribe(["users"]);
//!
//!    // Use observable writer for tracked changes
//!    let mut writer = observable.acquire_writer().await?;
//!    sqlx::query("BEGIN").execute(&mut *writer).await?;
//!    sqlx::query("INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES (?)")
//!       .bind("Alice")
//!       .execute(&mut *writer)
//!       .await?;
//!
//!    sqlx::query("COMMIT").execute(&mut *writer).await?;
//!    // Changes publish on commit!
//!
//!    // Read pool works as normal (no observation needed for reads)
//!    let rows = sqlx::query("SELECT * FROM users")
//!       .fetch_all(observable.read_pool()?)
//!       .await?;
//!
//!    Ok(())
//! }
//! ```

   ///   its changes to go. It's left out of the broker map rather than routed

   ///   those changes instead of misattributing them to this database.
